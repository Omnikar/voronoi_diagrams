# Voronoi Diagram Generator
This program randomly generates Voronoi diagrams using settings loaded from a config file.

### Usage
First, create a config file for the program to load; for this, you can just make a copy of `example_config.ini` and then change the values to what you want.

Once you've created your config file, run the program, it will prompt for the path to the config file, enter the path, and the program will run based on the settings in the file, given that the settings are valid.
